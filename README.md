# Ark_Software
The ark software is a website built to help lost ark players learn and clear difficult dungeons and raids.<br/> 

The website allows users to search for a particular dungeon or raid which will show them in-depth details of the bosses and mechanics present in the dungeon/raid.
<br/>

This project was developed as part of a Software Development paper at Auckland University of Technology by a team of 4. The outline of the project was to form small software teams and develop a project which interests the group. Our group was initially interested in creating a useful website for the game Lost Ark an intended to implement a small guide-based website aimed at educating users. We choses to develop the project using the MERN stack and worked in an agile development framework over the semester to create it.
