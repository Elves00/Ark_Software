Use this opportunity to\r\n            run as a team either clockwise or counterclockwise to the next orb.\r\n            Scarkrill returns to normal mode once all 4 orb explosions hit the\r\n            boss. Be aware that the spin attack of the boss and the orb explosion\r\n            combined deal a decent amount of damage to the player on hit. To\r\n            prevent this from happening, move or dodge immediately towards the\r\n            next orb as soon as the boss teleports to the orb next to you.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <div class=\"break\"></div>\r\n          <h2>Guide Video</h2>\r\n          <iframe\r\n            width=\"698\"\r\n            height=\"392\"\r\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOT3ZIOwth4\"\r\n            title=\"YouTube video player\"\r\n            frameborder=\"0\"\r\n            allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\r\n            allowfullscreen\r\n          ></iframe>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,EAA2BC,QAA3B,QAA2C,OAA3C;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,gBAAP;;AAEA,eAAe,SAASC,gBAAT,GAA4B;EAAA;;EAExC;EACA,MAAM,CAACC,IAAD,IAASH,QAAQ,CAAC,oBAAD,CAAvB;EAGAD,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;IACd,MAAMK,MAAM,GAAG;MACbC,MAAM,EAAE;QACN,gBAAgB;MADV;IADK,CAAf;;IAOA,IAAI;MACFJ,KAAK,CAACK,IAAN,CAAW,2BAAX,EACE;MACA;QAAEH;MAAF,CAFF,EAGEC,MAHF,EADE,CAMF;IACD,CAPD,CAOE,OAAOG,KAAP,EAAc;MACdC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYF,KAAZ;IACD;EAEF,CAnBQ,CAAT;EAqBD,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;IAAA,uBACE;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;MAAA,wBACE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,cAAf;UAAA,uBACE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAIE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;UAAA,wBACE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAhB;YAAA,gCACM;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADN;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAIE;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC;UAAX;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJF,eAKE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,UAAhB;YAAA,yCACe;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADf;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QALF,eAQE;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC;UAAX;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QARF,eASE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,SAAhB;YAAA,4CACkB;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADlB;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QATF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJF,eAiBE;UACE,GAAG,EAAC,mCADN;UAEE,GAAG,EAAC,aAFN;UAGE,SAAS,EAAC;QAHZ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjBF,eAsBE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAtBF,eAuBE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAvBF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAmCE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eAYE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAZF,eAaE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAbF,eAcE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAdF,eA0BE;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC;QAAX;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA1BF,eA2BE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3BF,eA4BE;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,KADR;UAEE,MAAM,EAAC,KAFT;UAGE,GAAG,EAAC,2CAHN;UAIE,KAAK,EAAC,WAJR;UAKE,WAAW,EAAC,GALd;UAME,KAAK,EAAC,0FANR;UAOE,eAAe;QAPjB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5BF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAnCF,eAyEE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eAQE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QARF,eASE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QATF,eAUE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAVF,eA0BE;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC;QAAX;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA1BF,eA2BE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3BF,eA4BE;UACE,KAAK,EAAC,KADR;UAEE,MAAM,EAAC,KAFT;UAGE,GAAG,EAAC,2CAHN;UAIE,KAAK,EAAC,sBAJR;UAKE,WAAW,EAAC,GALd;UAME,KAAK,EAAC,0FANR;UAOE,eAAe;QAPjB;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5BF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAzEF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADF;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAoHD;;GA/IuBL,gB"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
