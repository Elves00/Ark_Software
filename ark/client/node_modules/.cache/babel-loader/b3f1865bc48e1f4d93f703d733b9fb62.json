While in this mode the boss takes reduced damage and\r\n            only does teleport and spin attacks. At the same time, one orb\r\n            spawns at the edge of the battleground in each cardinal direction.\r\n            The only way to force the boss back to normal mode is to make him\r\n            teleport close to each of the orbs and do the spin attack. When\r\n            successful, the boss will destroy the orb with a spin attack and\r\n            make it explode. This explosion staggers the boss for a few seconds.\r\n            Use this opportunity to run as a team either clockwise or\r\n            counterclockwise to the next orb. Scarkrill returns to normal mode\r\n            once all 4 orb explosions hit the boss. Be aware that the spin\r\n            attack of the boss and the orb explosion combined deal a decent\r\n            amount of damage to the player on hit. To prevent this from\r\n            happening, move or dodge immediately towards the next orb as soon as\r\n            the boss teleports to the orb next to you.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <div class=\"break\"></div>\r\n          <br />\r\n          <h2>Guide Video</h2>\r\n          <div className=\"video\">\r\n            <iframe\r\n              width=\"698\"\r\n              height=\"392\"\r\n              src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOT3ZIOwth4\"\r\n              title=\"YouTube video player\"\r\n              frameborder=\"0\"\r\n              allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\r\n              allowfullscreen\r\n            ></iframe>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,EAA2BC,QAA3B,QAA2C,OAA3C;AACA,OAAOC,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,gBAAP;;AAEA,eAAe,SAASC,QAAT,GAAoB;EAAA;;EACjC;EACA,MAAM,CAACC,IAAD,IAASH,QAAQ,CAAC,oBAAD,CAAvB;EAEAD,SAAS,CAAC,MAAM;IACd,MAAMK,MAAM,GAAG;MACbC,MAAM,EAAE;QACN,gBAAgB;MADV;IADK,CAAf;;IAMA,IAAI;MACFJ,KAAK,CAACK,IAAN,CACE,2BADF,EAEE;MACA;QAAEH;MAAF,CAHF,EAIEC,MAJF,EADE,CAOF;IACD,CARD,CAQE,OAAOG,KAAP,EAAc;MACdC,OAAO,CAACC,GAAR,CAAYF,KAAZ;IACD;EACF,CAlBQ,CAAT;EAoBA,oBACE;IAAK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;IAAA,uBACE;MAAK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;MAAA,wBACE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,cAAf;UAAA,uBACE;YAAA;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAIE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAf;UAAA,wBACE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,YAAhB;YAAA,gCACM;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADN;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QADF,eAIE;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC;UAAX;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QAJF,eAKE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,UAAhB;YAAA,yCACe;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADf;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QALF,eAQE;YAAK,KAAK,EAAC;UAAX;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QARF,eASE;YAAM,SAAS,EAAC,SAAhB;YAAA,4CACkB;cAAA;YAAA;cAAA;cAAA;cAAA;YAAA,QADlB;UAAA;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA,QATF;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJF,eAiBE;UACE,GAAG,EAAC,mCADN;UAEE,GAAG,EAAC,aAFN;UAGE,SAAS,EAAC;QAHZ;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAjBF,eAsBE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAtBF,eAuBE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAvBF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QADF,eAmCE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eAYE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAZF,eAaE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAbF,eAcE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAdF,eA0BE;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC;QAAX;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA1BF,eA2BE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA3BF,eA4BE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5BF,eA6BE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;UAAA,uBACE;YACE,KAAK,EAAC,KADR;YAEE,MAAM,EAAC,KAFT;YAGE,GAAG,EAAC,2CAHN;YAIE,KAAK,EAAC,sBAJR;YAKE,WAAW,EAAC,GALd;YAME,KAAK,EAAC,0FANR;YAOE,eAAe;UAPjB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA7BF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QAnCF,eA4EE;QAAK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAf;QAAA,wBACE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eASE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QATF,eAUE;UAAI,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAd;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAVF,eAWE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAXF,eA4BE;UAAK,KAAK,EAAC;QAAX;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA5BF,eA6BE;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA7BF,eA8BE;UAAA;QAAA;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA9BF,eA+BE;UAAK,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;UAAA,uBACE;YACE,KAAK,EAAC,KADR;YAEE,MAAM,EAAC,KAFT;YAGE,GAAG,EAAC,2CAHN;YAIE,KAAK,EAAC,sBAJR;YAKE,WAAW,EAAC,GALd;YAME,KAAK,EAAC,0FANR;YAOE,eAAe;UAPjB;YAAA;YAAA;YAAA;UAAA;QADF;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QA/BF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA,QA5EF;IAAA;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADF;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AA4HD;;GApJuBL,Q;;KAAAA,Q"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
